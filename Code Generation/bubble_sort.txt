Sure! Here's an example of Python code for the Bubble Sort algorithm:

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    """
    This function performs bubble sort on a given list.

    Args:
        arr (list): The list to be sorted.

    Returns:
        list: The sorted list.
    """
    n = len(arr)

    # Traverse through all array elements
    for i in range(n - 1):
        
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n - i - 1):
            
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater
            # than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j + 1]:
                arr[j], arr[j + 1] = arr[j + 1], arr[j]

    return arr
```

In this code, the `bubble_sort` function takes an input list `arr` and performs the Bubble Sort algorithm on it. The function uses two nested loops to compare adjacent elements and swap them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the entire list is sorted. The sorted list is then returned.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
